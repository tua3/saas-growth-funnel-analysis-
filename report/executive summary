## 📌 Business Objective
The objective of this analysis is to evaluate the growth performance of a SaaS platform by analyzing the user onboarding funnel, activation behavior, paid conversions, churn trends, and marketing efficiency across acquisition channels.

- Subscription and revenue records
- Marketing spend by acquisition channel

## 🔍 Key Findings

### 1. Funnel Drop-Off During Onboarding
The largest user drop-off occurs between signup and first newsletter publication. While many users open the editor, a significant percentage fail to complete their first publish action, indicating onboarding friction or usability challenges.

### 2. Activation Rate
Approximately half of total signups successfully reach activation (first publish), suggesting an opportunity for onboarding optimization and early engagement interventions.

### 3. Paid User Churn
Churn is highest within the first few months after subscription, indicating that early customer success and value realization are critical to retention.

### 4. Marketing Efficiency
Organic and referral channels show lower Cost per Acquisition (CAC) compared to paid advertising channels, making them more sustainable growth drivers.
